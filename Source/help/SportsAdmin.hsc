\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Promote competitors from one final level into the next (say from a semi-final into a grand final)
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Generate "carnival disks" that can be sent to participating houses / schools / clubs for competitor nomination.  These disks are returned and imported into the \b\i Sports Administrator\b0\i0  and which then automatically adds the competitor into the database and into the correct events.  This alone can save hours of time for organisers of sports carnivals
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Create marshalling sheets to organise competitors and record competitor results.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Quickly enter competitor results for immediate processing and future reference
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Reuse the same carnival structure year after year.  This means that setting up the carnival needs to happen only once.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Save all carnival results indefinitely.  This means that any carnival statistic can be determined years after the running of the carnival.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Import competitors from a main administration database.
\par \pard\tx355\tx1075

\par \pard\fi-355\li1075\tx295\tx1135\f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The software can be networked.  This allows several people to enter results simultaneously.  This is often necessary for large carnivals.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Any number of point scales can be used.  This means that final places receive more points than semi-final places, which receive more points than quarter-final places and so on.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The \b\i Sports Administrator\b0\i0  can automatically create event heats.  This is very useful when there are dozens of heats to be entered.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The promotion of competitors from one final level to the next (i.e. semi-final to grand-final) can be done in either a staggered or smooth manner.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Events can be numbered easily so that they appear in the correct order on reports and forms.  
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Competing houses / schools / clubs can be allocated a "competitor pool total".  This can then be used to generate percentile results based on the number of competitors that the group had available to them.  This is particularly useful when schools of vastly differing sizes compete against each other.  It often gives a fairer indication of overall results.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The carnival organiser can customise the header and footer on all reports.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The \b\i Sports Administrator\b0\i0  uses the familiar Microsoft Access user interface.  The familiarity of the interface makes using the \b\i Sports Administrator\b0\i0  easier.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The \b\i Sports Administrator\b0\i0  is regularly updated to incorporate suggested changes and additions made by users of the program.  Customised reports can be regularly added if deemed appropriate.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Results can be entered in place order or lane order depending upon which is easiest.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Events can be set up for ages under or over a certain age.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Competitors from a particular house / school / club can be assigned default lanes.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The lanes into which competitors are promoted can be specified.  Higher place getters can be assigned the middle lanes whilst lower place getters the outside lanes.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\lang1033\b\f0\fs32 How to Set Up a Carnival
\par \fs20 
\par \b0 The Sports Administrator has a step by step guide to setting up a carnival.  This can be accessed by pushing the \cf2\b Set up Carnival\cf1\b0  button on the Main Menu.  It shows all the steps required to set up a carnival.  
\par 
\par There are two ways that a carnival can be set up.  However both methods require the following steps to be performed.
\par \b 
\par Required Steps for both Methods
\par \b0 
\par Create, Copy or Modify a \cf0 Carnival\cf1 .
\par Set up the \cf0 PointScales \cf1 you wish to use in the carnival.
\par Enter or select the \cf0 Teams\cf1  that will be competing at the carnival.  Houses or Schools will only be included if the Include check box is set.
\par Enter each \cf0 event\cf1  that will be offered at the carnival.
\par Allocate the \cf0 default lane(s)\cf1   to the house / school.
\par Set the \cf0 Event Numbers\cf1  which will be used to order the events.
\par 
\par \cf3\b\fs22 Method 1
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par Enter the competitors names\cf0  manually\cf1   \b AND/OR \b0  \cf0 Import\cf1  them from a \cf0 data\cf1  file.  
\par Enter \cf0 competitors into events\cf1 .
\par \cf0 
\par \cf3\b\fs22 Method 2
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par \cf0 Generate Carnival Data Disks\cf1 .  These disks are then sent to a house / school representative who will enter the names of each competitor against the appropriate event.  
\par \cf0 Import Carnival Data Disks\cf1 .  The disks are then returned and imported into the Sports Administrator.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\lang1033\b\f0\fs32 How to Maintain Carnivals
\par \b0\f1\fs20 
\par The \b Sports Administrator\b0  is quite flexible in the way it handles carnivals.  The \b Sports Administrator\b0  sets up a separate file for each carnival you create. This means you can have any number of carnivals \f2\ldblquote\f1 running\f2\rdblquote\f1  simultaneously.  It also makes it very easy to setup up subsequent carnivals by simply copying the old carnival to a new file. 
\par From the \cf2\b\f0 Maintain Carnivals\cf1\b0\f1  form it is possible to:
\par 
\par \pard\fi-355\li355\tx355\f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Create a New carnival that is completely blank
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Copy an existing Carnival to another name and modify it so that it meets new requirements
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Add (import) a Carnival
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Change the file associated with a carnival
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Rename a carnival
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Compact (and repair) a carnival file
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Delete a Carnival
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Select a new carnival to work on
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Import a carnival list from another \b Sports Administrator\b0  application file.
\par \pard\tx355 
\par Before the Sports Administrator can be used it is necessary to make a carnival active.  This can be done by either \cf2\f0 double-clicking\cf1\f1  on the appropriate carnival in the list or by selecting the appropriate carnival and pushing the \cf2\f0 Make Active\cf1\f1  button.  If the location for that carnival has changed and cannot be located, you will be asked to locate it manually.  Once located, it will be set as the active carnival.
\par 
\par \cf3\b\fs22 New Carnival
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par Pushing the New Carnival button enables you to create a completely empty carnival file.  A New Carnival dialog is displayed in which you must enter:
\par \pard\fi-355\li355\tx355\f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 A descriptive name for the new carnival. 
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 A file name for the new carnival.  Push the \cf2\b Locate\cf1\b0  button to select a file or enter a filename for the new carnival.  If the file does not exist simply locate the folder where you want the file to reside and type a new file name.
\par \pard\tx355 
\par A new empty carnival will be created.
\par \pard\li275\tx355 
\par \pard\tx355\cf3\b\fs22 Copy Carnival
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par To copy an existing carnival:
\par \pard\fi-355\li355\tx355\f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Highlight the carnival you wish to copy.
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Push the \cf2\f0 Copy\cf1\f1  button.  The \cf2\b\f0 Copy Carnival\cf1\b0\f1  dialog will appear.
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Enter a descriptive name for the new carnival. 
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Push the \cf2\f0 Locate\cf1\f1  button to enter a filename for the new carnival.
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Push the \cf2\f0 Copy\cf1\f1  button to create a copy of the selected carnival with the new name and filename location.
\par \pard\tx355 
\par \cf3\b\fs22 Add Carnival
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par Use this option if a carnival has already been created but is not listed in the carnival list.  This may be the case when adding a carnival that has been created by someone else or after a fresh installation of the \b Sports Administrator.\b0   To add a carnival:
\par \pard\fi-355\li355\tx355\f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Push the \cf2\f0 Add Carnival\cf1\f1  button.
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Enter a descriptive name that describes the carnival that is to be added.
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Locate the carnival file (it will have the extension .mdb)
\par \pard\tx355 
\par The carnival will be added to the list.
\par 
\par \cf3\b\fs22 Change Carnival File
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par Sometimes a carnival file name is renamed or the carnival is using the wrong file.  Push the \cf2\f0 Change File\cf1\f1  button to select a different carnival file.
\par 
\par \cf3\b\fs22 Rename Carnival
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par Select the carnival you wish to rename and push the \cf2\f0 Rename \cf1\f1 button.  The \cf2\b\f0 Rename Carnival\cf1\b0\f1  dialog will appear.  Enter the new name and push \cf2\f0 Rename\cf1\f1 .
\par 
\par \cf3\b\fs22 Compact Carnival
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par The carnival files will grow larger the more they are used.  Often there is space inside the file that can be recovered by compacting it.  Occasional a file can become corrupted.  Compacting the file will also repair any corruption that may have effected the file.  
\par 
\par The compact action actually creates a completely new compacted and repaired file.  The original carnival file is renamed to \f2\ldblquote\f1 original_carnival.mdb.old\f2\rdblquote\f1 .
\par 
\par \pard\fi-355\li355\tx355\f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Select the file you wish to Compact and push the \cf2\f0 Compact\cf1\f1  button.
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 If the carnival has been compacted previously then it is likely that a \f2\ldblquote\f1 original_carnival.mdb.old\f2\rdblquote\f1  file exists.  You are alerted to this fact and asked whether you wish to overwrite the \f2\ldblquote\f1 original_carnival.mdb.old\f2\rdblquote\f1  file.  
\par \pard\tx355 
\par \cf3\b\fs22 Delete Carnival
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par Select the carnival and push the \cf2\f0 Delete\cf1\f1  button.  Firstly, You must confirm that you wish to remove the carnival from the \b Sports Administrator\b0  list of carnivals.  If you answer \f2\ldblquote\f1 Yes\f2\rdblquote\f1  then the carnival will be removed from the list.  You must then confirm whether you wish to delete the file associated with the carnival.  If you answer \f2\ldblquote\f1 Yes\f2\rdblquote\f1  the file will be deleted.  You will be informed that the carnival file cannot be deleted if it is not in the location specified in the \b Sports Administrator\b0 .
\par 
\par \cf3\b\fs22 Make Active
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par Use the \cf2\b Make Active\cf1\b0  button to make the carnival active.  When a carnival is active it can be manipulated by the Sports Administrator.  Double clicking on the desired carnival will also make it active.
\par \b 
\par \cf3\fs22 Import Carnival List
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par After reinstalling or upgrading the \b Sports Administrator\b0  the list of carnival files will be replaced by the default list contained in the installation.  If the old \f2\ldblquote\f1 sports.mde\f2\rdblquote\f1  file (the main \b Sports Administrator\b0  application file has not been deleted, then you can import all the old carnivals from it into the newly installed or upgraded version.  
\par To do this:
\par \pard\fi-355\li355\tx355\f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Push the \cf2\f0 Import Carnival List\cf1\f1  button.
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Locate the old \f2\ldblquote\f1 Sports.mde\f2\rdblquote\f1  file and push open.
\par \f3\fs18\'b7\f4\tab\f1\fs20 Any carnivals that don\f2\rquote\f1 t already exist in the \b Sports Administrator\b0  will be added to the list.

\par \cf1\fs20 
\par \b0 The details of the event that is being edited are shown in the top left of the form.  These details can not be modified on this form.  They can be modified in the \b Maintain Event Details\b0  form.
\par The Event Number in the top right corner of the form can be modified.
\par 
\par 
\par \cf2\b\fs22 Final Level Details
\par \cf1\fs20 
\par \b0 Below the event details section of the form is the Final details.  The event final level and event heat are displayed here.  
\par The \b Complete\b0  checkbox shows whether the \ul heat\ulnone  has been completed.  This value can be modified by the user.
\par This value is automatically updated after the user enters the places or times for competitors.  It is assumed that the heat has been completed if every competitor in the event has been assigned either a place or a result.  If this condition is not satisfied then the Sports Administrator will not set the heat as completed.
\par The Sports Administrator will prompt the user if it is necessary to overwrite existing places.  On occasions the results entered will not reconcile with the places gained.  This is especially true for short sprint events and when using individual stop watches.  The user may "fudge" the times so that they equate to the places OR enter the places manually.  It is in this latter instance that automatic calculation of places using the "inaccurate" times will yield "incorrect" places.
\par 
\par The \cf0 status of this event\cf1  is shown beside the final level.  This can be modified by the user but it is not recommended.  The status colour changes to help identify the status of the event quickly.
\par 
\par \cf2\b\fs22 Competitor List
\par \cf1\b0\fs20 
\par The largest area at the bottom of the screen is where competitors can be entered into events and where their results can be recorded.
\par \cf3\{bml bm2.BMP\}\cf1 
\par The \cf3\b lane\cf1\b0  is automatically entered by the Sports Administrator.  The appropriate lane is determined by looking up what default lane(s) have been assigned to that competitors team.  The lane value can be set manually by the user if necessary.  If the competitors in the event has been determined by using the Sports Administrator \b Promotion\b0  function then the lanes will be determined by \b Promotion Lanes\b0  set up in the \b Event Details \b0 form.  If no default lanes have been configured then the competitor will be assigned lane 0.  \b Note \b0 that those competitors who have been assigned lane 0 will not appear in some reports.  However, the results gained by these competitors will be included in the grand totals.
\par The \cf3\b Team, Pts and PIN\cf1\b0  field can not be modified.
\par The \cf3 c\b ompetitor name\cf1\b0  must be selected from the list (see \cf0 form navigation\cf1  help screen).  By default, only the competitors who meet satisfy the age  criteria will be shown.  If it is necessary to select a competitor who does not satisfy the age criteria, check the \b Select from all names\b0  check box on the top right of the form.  The Sports Administrator will then display all names in the drop down box.  \b Note\b0 : The competitor's details can be accessed by \b double clicking\b0  on the competitor's name.
\par Either the \cf3\b place, the result \cf1\b0 or both can be entered.  The Sports Administrator will automatically determine places from the given results.  (See the see \cf0 form navigation\cf1  help screen for an explanation of how to enter results.)  Points will be allocated when a place is given to a competitor.  If no place is assigned, or the place is set to 0 or the place is deleted then no points will be assigned.  Tied results are handled in the following way.  Consider these sample results from a 100m Sprint:
\par Results: 10sec; 11sec; 12sec; 12sec; 13sec     would give the following places
\par Places: 1; 2; 4; 4; 5
\par or
\par Results: 10sec; 11sec; 12sec; 12sec; 12sec; 13sec     would give the following places
\par Places: 1; 2; 5; 5; 5; 6
\par 
\par The button \cf3\{bmc bm3.BMP\} \cf1 is used to add a memo to the competitor.  The primary use for this function is for storing the names of relay team competitors.  However this will not attribute any points gained to those individual competitors.
\par 
\par \cf2\b\fs22 Enter Results in Place Order
\par \cf0\b0\f2\fs24 
\par \cf1\f1\fs20 This action opens another form where the competitors lanes and results can be entered beside the place gained.  This form is only useful when the competitors lanes are know\lang3081\f3 n\lang1033\f1  prior to the running of the event.  Some computerized timing systems will only give results in place order with the competitor's lane beside the place gained.  This form allow the user to enter the results into the Sports Administrator directly from the timing sheet received from computerized timing system.
\par 
\par \cf2\b\fs22 Calculate places

\par This is a simple method of entering both competitor names and events.  Once the events have been completely set up, the \b Sports Administrator\b0  will generate a separate text file for each team in the carnival.  These files can then be given to the appropriate representative who will enter the names of the competitors against the appropriate event.
\par 
\par To \cf2\b\f0 Create Carnival Disks\cf1\b0\f1 :
\par 
\par \pard\fi-275\li395\tx355\f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Select the teams to generate the files for (tick the appropriate boxes).
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Specify the gender format to be used in the generated text file.  In some instances the carnival organiser may prefer to have the events described as "girls or boys" as opposed to "female or male".
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Specify the Heat format.  Likewise, the heats can be presented in either alpha or numeric format.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Enter the location that the file created by the Sports Administrator will be saved.
\par \pard\tx355 
\par The file generated consists of the following:
\par 
\par \pard\li275\tx355\f4 Reference Number, House/School Code, Gender, Age, Event Description, Heat, Competitor Number, Given Name, Surname
\par \pard\tx355

\par 
\par Suppose there are two Final Levels (level 1 & 0) for both the 100m event and the 400m event.  Suppose also that the 100m event is run to completion first and then the 400m event is conducted.  At the commencement of the carnival both events have the same Active Final Level (i.e. Final Level 1).  The 100m event is run first until Final Level 1is completed.  At the completion of this Final Level the best competitors are promoted into the next (and in this case the last) Final Level.  Now the Active Final Level for the 100m event is 0.  However the Active Final Level for the 400m event remain unchanged.  It is still 1 since Final Level 1 is the Final Level that is 'currently' being contested.\cf0

\par 
\par Note: It is possible that there will be a number of competitors who come under the "UNKNOWN" age group.  This is due to the way in which the event age groups are specified.  This report generate a list for each event age group, not for each competitor age group.  This means that all the 16_O (16 and over) competitors are found in the one list which is what is usually required.  However, if there is no event age group into which a competitor would normally fall, then he or she is included in the "UNKNOWN" category.  This would occur when there was a 17 year old competitor with no event age group that included 17 year olds (i.e.. no 15_O, 16_O, 17, 18_U, 19_U etc.)

\par \cf0 The Sports Administrator has a number of ways of presenting event lists.  This is necessary due to the fact that events vary both in their format and in the number of competitors allowed to compete.  The sports administrator provides a number of reports that cater for almost every event type.  The following report styles are available:
\par 
\par \b Limited Lanes\b0 : Most sprint events would use this report style.  
\par 
\par \b Unlimited Lanes\b0 :  Events such as 1500m, marathons, cross countries etc would use this report style.
\par 
\par \b Relay Limited Lanes\b0 : Most relays would use this report style. The reason for a separate report is to enable the inclusion of the names of the competitors that make up a relay team.  A relay can use the Limited Lanes report style if so desired.
\par 
\par \b Field (3 Attempts)\b0 : All field events that allow only three attempts would use this report style.  This would include Long Jump, Javelin, Discus etc.
\par 
\par \b Field (High Jump)\b0 : High jump and Pole Vault are two examples of events that would need to use this report style.

\par \b0\f1\fs20 
\par It can be a time consuming process to specify all the Heats in each \cf0 Final Level\cf1  for every \cf0 Age/Gender division\cf1 .  To simplify the task, the carnival organiser can use the Setup Heats feature found on the Event Details form (and also in the Add Event Wizard).   
\par 
\par The form allows you to specify:
\par 
\par 1. How many heats will be offered in each final level.
\par 2. What point scale is used for each final level.
\par 3. What promotion method is used to promote from one final level into the next.
\par 4. Whether places or points are used as the promotion criteria.
\par 5. (Optional) The number of competitors allowed in each heat for events where there is no lane limit (800m, 1500m, field events etc)
\par 
\par \cf0\f0 Some examples are the best way to understand this.
\par 
\par \b\i Example 1\b0\i0 : Say we are working on the 100m Sprint.  Each \i Event\i0  is comprised of at most 6 heats from which the top 8 competitors race in a single grand final.  We would enter the following:
\par 
\par \trowd\trgaph109\trleft-101\trqc\cellx974\cellx2044\cellx2944\cellx4153\cellx5503\cellx6583\pard\intbl\b\fs16 Final Level\cell # of Heats\cell Point Scale\cell Promotion Method\cell Use Results (X) / Places ()\cell # of Comp in Heat\cell\row

\intbl 1\cell 6\cell HEATS\cell SMOOTH\cell X\cell\cell\row
\pard\fs20 
\par As always, the first Final-Level is 0 (grand-final) and our second Final-Level is 1 (for the heats).  There is only a single grand-final \f2\lquote\f0 heat\f2\rquote\f0  so the \f2\ldblquote\f0 # of Heats\f2\rdblquote\f0  for Final Level 0 is set to 1.  However there a 6 heats for Final-Level 1 so  \f2\ldblquote\f0 # of Heats\f2\rdblquote\f0  is set to 6. The Point Scale choices are determined by what you set up previously.  In this instance the promotion method doesn't matter seeing we are promoting into a single event only so we could choose either Smooth or Staggered.  Lastly, we will use results to do the promoting (which is almost always the case) seeing that we are interested in the 8 fastest rather than the 8 who came first and second but may not have gained the best times. 
\par 
\par \b\i Example 2\b0\i0 : Say we are working on the 100m Sprint.  Each \i Event\i0  is comprised of only 8 'heats' with NO grand final (this is often the case when there is insufficient time to run a grand-final).  We would enter the following:
\par 
\par \trowd\trgaph109\trleft-101\trqc\cellx974\cellx2044\cellx2944\cellx4153\cellx5503\cellx6583\pard\intbl\b\fs16 Final Level\cell # of Heats\cell Point Scale\cell Promotion Method\cell Use Results (X) / Places ()\cell # of Comp in Heat\cell\row

\pard\fs20 
\par As always, the first Final Level is 0. There are 8 heats so the \f2\ldblquote\f0 # of Heats\f2\rdblquote\f0  for Final Level 0 is set to 8.  Again the Point Scale options are determined by what you set up before.  In this instance the promotion method is set to \f2\ldblquote\f0 None\f2\rdblquote\f0  since we are not promoting into any event (there are no grand finals as such).  Lastly, the results field can be set at either \f2\ldblquote\f0 Results\f2\rdblquote\f0  or \f2\ldblquote\f0 Places\f2\rdblquote\f0  since we are not promoting any events. 
\par

There are three final levels: quarter-final, semi-final and grand-final.  The \i fastest 60\i0  competitors in the quarter-finals (20 per race) go into the semi-final (15 per race).  Then the fastest 10 go into the grand final. We would enter the following:

\par \cf0\b0\f1\fs20 
\par The \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator\cf0\b0\f1  can be used on a limited number of computers simultaneously.  The practical limit is determined by the speed of both the computers and the network link between them.  The \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator\cf0\b0\f1  should work fine on a network of 2 to 5 computers.  
\par 
\par The following provides a brief guide to networking the \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator.\cf0\b0\f1  
\par 
\par \pard\fi-355\li355\tx355\f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator\cf0\b0\f1  uses simple file sharing to provide network support.  Thus the \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator\cf0\b0\f1  can be run on virtually any network system.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator\cf0\b0\f1  application must be installed on each computer.  (Or at least the sports.mde file must be located on each computer).
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Locate the carnival file(s) on the fastest computer available.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The carnival file (or files) that you want to access must be on a computer (either a desktop or a server) that can be accessed from all other computers.  
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 One of the simplest ways of doing this is through Peer-to-Peer networking of Windows 9x or Windows NT.  Share the folder where the carnival file is stored. Check that the shared folder can be seen from the other computers. Start the \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator\cf0\b0\f1  and go to the \cf2\b Maintain Carnivals\cf0\b0  form. Push the \cf2 Add\cf0  button.  Enter a descriptive name for the carnival and \cf2 locate\cf0  the carnival file in the shared folder.   That\f4\rquote\f1 s it!
\par \pard\tx355 
\par Note: 
\par \pard\fi-355\li355\tx355\f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator\cf0\b0\f1  will not let two people work on the same record at the same time.  The \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator\cf0\b0\f1  will inform you if this event occurs.
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Backing up the carnival file (or compacting it) can only be performed when the carnival file is not in use.  To ensure the backup can be completed either have all other computers go to the \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator\cf0\b0\f1  \cf2\b Main Menu\cf0\b0  screen or exit the \cf1\b\f0 Sports Administrator\cf0\b0\f1  entirely.

\par \cf0\b0\f1\fs20 
\par The \b Sports Administrator\b0  has a separate module called \i Sports View\i0 .  It is designed to allow competitors to view their results only.  No modifications to the carnival results can be made from this module.  Launch the module from the shortcut created when you installed the program (the default location is Start | Programs | Sports Administrator | Sports View).
\par 
\par Certain aspects of the program are password protected.  The initial password is \f2\ldblquote\f1 password\f2\rdblquote\f1 .  It can be changed by going into the \i Maintain Carnivals\i0  form.  If you forget the password then simply restore the \f2\ldblquote\f1 sportsview.mde\f2\rdblquote\f1  file from the distribution CD.
\par 
\par Competitors can check their results, check current age champion placings, and check the results for all competitors in any event.

\par \pard\tx355 
\par \b Note:
\par 
\par \b0 Because MS Access database files are used to store the carnival results, you are able to access those files through MS Access or through a number of other applications including MS Word and MS Excel.  This means that you could generate your own reports and graphs.  Feel free to access the results in this manner but DO NOT modify the data.  This could compromise the integrity of the database.
\par 
\par A number of web template files and documents are stored in sub-folders under the installation directory.  Feel free to use and modify these documents.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\lang1033\b\f0\fs32 Quick Start Guide 
\par \cf0\b0\f1\fs20 
\par Here is a brief quick start guide to get your carnival underway.
\par 
\par \pard\fi-355\li355\tx355\f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Have a good look at the demo carnival.  Play with this one a bit to familiarise yourself with the program. Don\f4\rquote\f1 t be too concerned about modifying it.  You can always reinstall the demo file later.
\par 
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 On the main menu push the \i Setup Carnival\i0  button.  
\par 
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Follow the steps one through eight to set up your carnival from scratch.  
\par 
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Firstly create a new carnival.  Give it a name and specify a file for the carnival to be stored in.
\par 
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Setup the necessary point scales.  Usually there are different point scales for different events.  For example grand finals usually receive more points then heats.
\par 
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Add the appropriate teams that will be competing in the carnival.  
\par 
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Add the events that will be held during the carnival.  It is a good idea to set up one event first making sure that is correct and then copy it to create the other events.
\par 
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Allocate default lanes to each team if you haven\f4\rquote\f1 t done so already.  The Sports Administrator will automatically put competitors into these lanes when they are enrolled in an event.
\par 
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 Set the event order.  This is optional and is not usually necessary for carnivals where marshalling lists aren\f4\rquote\f1 t used 
\par 
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 If you are responsible for entering the competitors into the events push the enter competitors button.  (The \i\scaps sports administrator\i0\scaps0  also allows you to generate disks with all the events on for each team.  A person for each team can then enter the competitors\f4\rquote\f1  names into the events for you.  This feature is usually only used for inter-school carnivals or the like).
\par There are two ways of getting competitors into your carnival. 
\par 
\par a) The easiest way is to import all competitor details from a text file that can be generated by, say, a school administration system.  The required format can be found in the help file.  Push the \i Import Carnival Competitors from a Text File\i0  button.
\par 
\par b) Alternatively you can enter each competitor manually.  Push the \i Enter Carnival Competitors Manually\i0  button.
\par 
\par Lastly you must enroll competitors into events.  Push the \i Enter Competitors into Events\i0  button, select the event to enter competitors into and start adding competitors to it.
\par 
\par \f2\fs18\'b7\f3\tab\f1\fs20 The last thing to do is to generate event lists.  Again this may not be necessary if you do not require marshalling sheets.
\par \fs22 
\par \fs20 Your carnival is now ready.  When competitor results start coming in push the \i Enter Results\i0  button on the Main Menu to begin entering them.

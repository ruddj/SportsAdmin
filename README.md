Sports Carnival Management Software 

This is an access database for managing results for a school Athletics or Swimming carnival. 
It has many features listed below as well as been easy to use.
  * Easy entry of event results 
  * Tracking of event records 
  * Cumulative house points 
  * Age Champions
  * Reports to show 

The database was originally developed by Andrew Rogers, in conjunction with Christian Outreach College, Brisbane. He has generously allowed it to be made open source, to allow further development and allow it to run on more modern systems.


All coding occurs in the Sports.accdb file. The Source folder contains a text dump of contents to allow diff comparison of changes. 
This is generated through use of [msaccess-vcs-integration](https://github.com/timabell/msaccess-vcs-integration) scripts.
To export source run "ExportAllSource" in Immediate window.

This database requires Microsoft Access 2013 or newer. If you do not have this installed you can download the [Microsoft Access 2016 Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50040).

If you wish to have a version for end users you can change the Sports.accdb file extension to .accdr to load in runtime only mode.
